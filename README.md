# project1
This project was made by Tom Dennis, Tom Schofield, Oumar Oumar, and Thor Lucas. 
This project creates a group listening room for spotify users to create collaborative playlists.
The following technologies were used to accomplish this task:
Spotify API, Socket.io, Node, Express, Materialize, Semantic UI, (Local storage*), (FireBase*) 
(Firebase and local storage were not included in the final version of this project, although future development will involve 
reworking socket.io and adding database functionality with firebase for a more functional product. Other future improvements my include
building the functionality to create multiple listening rooms and make them accessible via email link, increased player functionality, 
adding visualizations, adding a discover mode to find new music, and adding functionality to download and save playlists
